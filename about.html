  Hey! That's me up there ^!!! Based out of Madison, WI, I currently work at Springs Window Fashions as a Web Designer but my role falls more along the lines of performing web maintainence and Web Designer / Front-End Developer. I've been here for roughly 2 years now and have had the opportunity to work on roughly 5 different site set-ups and work on many different web updates, issues, page builds and maintainence workflows.

  This site is build on Jekyll with some Bootstrap SASS that I ported into it. The mobile navigation is wonky but whatever. I'm working on that soon. I also loosely follow the AirBNB style guide for my SASS. I don't really prefer the alphabetical properties.

  Lately, I've been very interested in 3D printing and 3D modelling. I play fantasy football and am interested in learning some data science to help support that. I really just want to visualize data. I recently set up a Raspberry Pi with a retroPie emulator.

  Outside of the web I like to weight lift. I'm learning how to ski and cross country ski. It makes for a nice reason to get outside in the winter. I also read a lot. Mostly Sci-fi and fantasy but I also like to dive into non-fiction from time to time.

  I like to use Colour Lovers to make cool palettes from time to time and I really like that you can name colors that you are the first to find. Here are some colors that I "discovered" and named on Colour Lovers:
