## Update 10/10/2019
I'm 10 days in now. It's been easy going for the most part regarding the habits. I clearly have been prioritizing hanging, counting calories and walking over development, writing and yoga. I'm beginning to realize that this may be a few too many things to track and focus on.

Along with all this, not drinking has been interesting. I feel good, but I've also wanted to have a few beers. I've almost broke a few times now. Is it really worth being so tough on myself? Dunno yet. Work has been taxing and I've had a few days were I just want to unwind. I'm going to give it some thought before I drink, but my first planned drinking night, oct. 18 is coming up in a week. I can probably hold out until then.

I'm curious to see my weight over the month. It will probably be largely unchanged, but I've cut out alcohol calories. I did also snack hard of some cheezits and some good good malt vinegar chips. 

This counts as writing. Mark it dood. ta ta til next time

## Update 10/31/2019
Today is the last day. After doing the tracking for a month, I realized quite a few things on here become much less important to me. Yoga fell to the way side, mostly because I got hurt and didn't want to spend the money on a membership. Writing is a lot to do. I feel like I could have focused on it more, but it didn't feel right.

My plan for sober october fell through too. I feel good about my choice though especially given that I had two days pre-planned where I would drink. I think tracking some habits was helpful here. I think I'll continue but on a weekly basis and change it up each week. I think I set out with too many things to track and that made it hard to be consistent. Even though I set up desired weekly frequencies for each habit, I felt a little bad when I didnt meet each one everyday.

Going forward, I want to try and do a sober month, but I want to plan it out a bit better. I think February would be great for this. With winter coming, I want to focus on my fitness.
