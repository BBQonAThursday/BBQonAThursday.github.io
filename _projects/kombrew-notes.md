# Brew Notes 7/1/19 :
### Brew 1
* 150g sugar
* 1250g water
* 12g teabags

I just made a 300g simple syrup.
Added in 4 backs of darjeeling black tea.
Added 1100g water. 

Intent: getting a peach test batch using the original recipe from noma. Also re-sugaring the scoby, which may effect the flavor

### Brew 2 & 3
* 209g sugar
* 1027g water

split into two different buckets. I used the BIG SCoby for this one, cutting it into half. 
Intent: Re-sugar the scob in prep for a new batch in a week.
I'm going to do a batch of peach puree using the Mango recipe from noma.
