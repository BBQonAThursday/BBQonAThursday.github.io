# Working with Data

6/02/19: This is currently a test with json. Below, I've imported foods.json and then looped through the object to build cards with each one. I want to add a button to add items to the json and also be able to fill out items for logging. Filtering the data would be cool as well. I should build out tags for each item though and have that data validate too.


<div id="food-data-display" class="food-item-container">

</div>
