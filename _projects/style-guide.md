# Style Guide

This contains the typography styles for my site as well as the colors used and components I want to test out. Mostly, I just want a little playground page.

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

[This is a link](/style-guide.md)

Paragraphs can be long and dangerous. Don't go alone. This one is somewhat short. Just long enough 
to demonstrate what it looks like when a paragraph wraps lines after hitting its max length.

<div class="site-colors">
  <div class="style-guide-color brand-primary"></div>
  <div class="style-guide-color brand-secondary"></div>
  <div class="style-guide-color brand-third"></div>
  <div class="style-guide-color brand-fourth"></div>
  <div class="style-guide-color brand-dark-accent"></div>
</div>
