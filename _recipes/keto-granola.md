Place the chilies, shallots, garlic, ginger, lemongrass, coriander, cumin, shrimp meal, cilantro, basil, white pepper, fish sauce, swerve and lime juice in food processor and mix until a smooth past is formed. Set aside.

In a large, heavy-bottomed skillet or a wok, melt the coconut oil on high heat. When the oil is hot, add the chicken and quickly brown on the outside, for about 2 minutes.

Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside. Add the curry paste to the pan and quickly stir-fry for about 1 minute, then add the coconut milk and the chicken to the pan. Bring to a slow simmer, then reduce the head to low and cover. Cook until the chicken is fully done, stirring occasionally, about 8 to 10 minutes. Add the lime zest and stir well. Serve immediately on Easy Cauliflower Rice or with Keto Paleo Naan bread.

Note: Shrimp meal is available in the Hispanic food section of supermarkets; as with lemongrass paste, read the ingredients_it should only contain dried shrimp.
