This is a culmination of my work on the web. I also keep some of my sandbox projects here where I like to test out new features and learn. My main focus is as a web design and developer, but I also do video editing from time to time.
      
### Professionally, I'm a web designer at Springs Window Fashions. 

This includes managing product ordering experiences and workflows, designing new landing pages and implementing UI features.
